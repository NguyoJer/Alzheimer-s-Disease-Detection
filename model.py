    Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive disorder that destroys memory and other important mental functions. It is the most common cause of dementia among older adults. According to Alzheimer's association, AD is incurable and the sixth leading cause of death in the united states and is expected to become four times as of now by the end of 2050. Although there is no cure for Alzheimers disease, getting a diagnosis quickly at an early stage helps patients. It allows them to access help and support, get treatment to manage their symptoms, and plan for the future. However, it can be challenging to diagnose Alzheimers disease, which can lead to suboptimal patient care.
